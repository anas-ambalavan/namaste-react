### 2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState()) ?

### 3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?

- useEffect runs on each render cycle.

### 4. What is SPA ?

- SPAs(Single Page Application) are web applications that operate within a single webpage. SPAs use JavaScript frameworks to dynamically update the page's content instead of loading new pages from the server.

### 5. What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing ?

- `Client-side routing` and `Server-side routing` are two different approaches used in web development to handle navigation and content rendering.
- `Client-side routing` involves handling routing logic on the client's web browser using JavaScript. When a user clicks on a link or enters a URL, the browser updates the content dynamically without full-page reloads.
- `Server-side routing` processes routing logic on the server. When a user requests a page, the server returns the complete HTML content for that route. This approach offers better initial loading time and SEO performance but may result in slower navigation and increased server requests.
